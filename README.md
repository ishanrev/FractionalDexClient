## 🔗 Live Demo
[Dexify](https://dexify.vercel.app)

## 📜 Overview
Dexify is a decentralized platform designed to **fractionalize NFTs**, allowing them to be traded as liquid assets. By wrapping NFTs into **automated market maker (AMM) based decentralized exchanges (DEXs)**, the platform generates liquidity and enables seamless fractional ownership through custom **ERC20 tokens**. 

With Dexify, NFT owners can tokenize their assets into tradeable shares, making it easier for investors to buy and sell fractions of high-value NFTs. The platform leverages **Solidity smart contracts**, **Ethers.js**, and **Next.js** to provide a seamless and secure Web3 experience.

## 🔧 Features
- **Fractionalized NFT Ownership** - Wrap NFTs into ERC20-based liquidity pools, allowing multiple users to own and trade fractions.
- **AMM-Based DEXs** - Each fractionalized NFT has its own custom liquidity pool for efficient trading.
- **Smart Contract Integration** - Secure and transparent issuance of fractional tokens through Solidity contracts.
- **Seamless Web3 Experience** - Uses **Thirdweb SDK**, **Ethers.js**, and **Supabase** for blockchain interactions and data management.
- **Enhanced NFT Liquidity** - Enables NFT holders to create liquidity by converting NFTs into **fractional shares**.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Blockchain & Smart Contracts:** Solidity, Ethers.js, Thirdweb SDK
- **Frontend:** Next.js, TypeScript
- **Database:** Supabase (for metadata and user interactions)
- **Deployment:** Vercel

## 📜 Smart Contracts
- **Fractionalization Contract**: Wraps an NFT and mints equivalent ERC20 tokens for trading.
- **Liquidity Pool Contract**: Implements an **AMM model** to allow seamless trading between NFT fractions.
- **Governance & Buyback Mechanism** *(Future Enhancements)*: Provides a way for NFT owners to reclaim full ownership by purchasing back all fractional shares.

## 💡 Future Enhancements
- Cross-chain NFT fractionalization for **multi-chain liquidity**.
- Governance model for **fractional token holders** to vote on key decisions.
- Advanced analytics dashboard to track **NFT liquidity pool performance**.
